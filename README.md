# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project involves predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to leverage data-driven models to assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential diabetes cases effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the *PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset*, which contains information about several medical and lifestyle factors for individuals, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). Key features include:
- Number of pregnancies
- Blood pressure
- BMI
- Glucose level
- Insulin level
- Age

## Features
- *Preprocessing*: Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis*: Visualization of feature distributions and relationships to understand data patterns.
- *Model Building*: Training and testing various algorithms like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.
- *Metrics*: Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Results
The project successfully predicts diabetes likelihood with a high accuracy rate. It also highlights the importance of certain features, such as glucose levels and BMI, in determining diabetes risk.

## Tools & Libraries
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of additional features for better accuracy.
- Deployment of the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-world usage.
- Exploration of advanced techniques like ensemble models and neural networks.
