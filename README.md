# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Predicting diabetes at an early stage can help in timely intervention and prevention of complications. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict diabetes using medical and demographic data.

## Objectives
- To develop a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes.
- To identify the most significant features contributing to diabetes prediction.
- To evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Dataset: [Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
   - The dataset includes features such as Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThikness,Insulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction and Age

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Normalizing numerical features.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Analyzing feature importance.
   - Selecting features that significantly impact diabetes prediction.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Implementing and training machine learning models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
   - Cross-validation to ensure robustness.

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **78%** on the train dataset.
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **77%** on the test dataset.
- Feature importance analysis highlighted `glucose` and `BMI` as critical predictors.

## Challenges
- Imbalanced dataset leading to biased predictions.
- Difficulty in tuning hyperparameters for some models.

## Future Scope
- Incorporating additional features such as lifestyle and genetic factors.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time diabetes risk assessment.

## Conclusion
Machine learning has proven to be an effective tool for predicting diabetes. With further enhancements and integration into healthcare systems, this approach can support early diagnosis and better patient care.
